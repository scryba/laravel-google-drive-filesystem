## 3. Get Refresh Token and Access Token (OAuth 2.0 Playground)

1. Go to the [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/).
2. Click the gear icon (top right) and check **Use your own OAuth credentials**. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret from the previous step.
3. In **Step 1**, enter the scope:

   ```
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
   ```

   and click **Authorize APIs**.
4. Sign in with your Google account and allow access.
5. In **Step 2**, click **Exchange authorization code for tokens**.
6. You will see your **Access token** and **Refresh token**. Copy these values for your `.env` file.

## 4. (Optional) Get Google Drive Folder ID

1. Open the folder in Google Drive.
2. Copy the last part of the URL after `folders/`:
   - Example: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/<your-folder-id>`

---

## 5. Add to Your .env File

```
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token
GOOGLE_DRIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your-folder-id (optional)
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you get errors, double-check your credentials and scopes.
- The refresh token is only shown the first time you authorize a new client. If you lose it, repeat the process.
- For more help, see the [Google Drive API documentation](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-auth).
